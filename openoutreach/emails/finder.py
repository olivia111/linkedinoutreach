"""Resolve a work email for a qualified lead, on demand.

`resolve_email` is the public entry point; BetterContact is the one provider
(see bettercontact.py). Called lazily when a lead needs an email — it submits
the lookup and waits for the result. A missing API key or a miss yields None,
never an error, so enrichment can't take down the daemon.
