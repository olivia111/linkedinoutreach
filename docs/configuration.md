# Configuration

Configuration is split between environment variables (`.env` file), Django models (managed via interactive
onboarding or Django Admin), and hardcoded defaults in `linkedin/conf.py`.

## LLM Configuration (`.env`)

LLM settings are stored in `.env` (project root). Any
OpenAI-compatible provider works. These are prompted during interactive onboarding if missing.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|:---------|:------------|:--------|
| `LLM_API_KEY` | API key for an OpenAI-compatible provider. | (required) |
| `AI_MODEL` | Model identifier for qualification, follow-up, and search keyword generation. | (required) |
| `LLM_API_BASE` | Base URL for the API endpoint. | (none) |

These can also be set as environment variables directly.

## Human-in-the-loop Approval (`REQUIRE_APPROVAL`)

Every outbound action that leaves the machine is gated behind an interactive
confirmation. With `REQUIRE_APPROVAL` on (the default), the daemon pauses and
prompts `Proceed? [y/N]` before each of:

- a LinkedIn connection request,
- a LinkedIn follow-up message,
- a cold email,
- an OpenOutreach newsletter signup,
- a contacts-store (hub) contribution,
- a paid BetterContact email lookup.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|:---------|:------------|:--------|
| `REQUIRE_APPROVAL` | Require interactive `y/N` confirmation before any outbound action. `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` restores the original fully-autonomous behavior. | `1` (on) |

Behavior:

- **On + interactive terminal** → prompts; only an explicit `y`/`yes` proceeds. Anything else skips that one action (non-destructive — the daemon moves to the next slot; the item may be re-offered on a later cycle).
- **On + no TTY (headless/Docker)** → every gated action is **denied** and logged. Run the daemon attached to a terminal to approve actions, or set `REQUIRE_APPROVAL=0` to run unattended.
- **Off** → no prompts; original autonomous behavior.

The gate lives in `core/approval.py`; the default is set in `core/conf.py`.
Related: the GDPR newsletter/contribution auto-overrides (`linkedin/setup/geo.py`)
are disabled — no opt-in flag is ever flipped automatically; `subscribe_newsletter`
and `contribute_to_hub` stay exactly as set in Django Admin, and new onboarding
defaults both to **off**.

## Campaign Settings (Django Model)

Campaign data is stored in the `Campaign` Django model (with `name` and `users` M2M), managed via
Django Admin (`/admin/`) or created during interactive onboarding.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| `product_docs` | text | Product/service description. Used by LLM qualification, follow-up agent, and search keyword generation. |
| `campaign_objective` | text | Campaign goal. Used by LLM qualification, follow-up agent, and search keyword generation. |
| `booking_link` | string | URL included in follow-up messages when suggesting a meeting. |
| `is_freemium` | boolean | Whether this is a freemium campaign (uses KitQualifier instead of BayesianQualifier). |
| `action_fraction` | float | Target fraction of total connections for freemium campaigns. |
| `auto_generate_keywords` | boolean | When `True` (default), the LLM generates People search queries from `product_docs` + `campaign_objective`. Set `False` to use only operator-supplied `SearchKeyword` rows and never call the LLM for keywords. |

### Supplying your own People search queries

To skip LLM keyword generation and search with queries you write yourself, pass
them to the read-only discovery command:

```bash
# Inline; turns OFF auto_generate_keywords for the campaign
python manage.py discover --queries "CTO fintech London" "VP Engineering SaaS"

# From a file (one query per line; blank lines and #-comments ignored)
python manage.py discover --queries-file queries.txt

# Keep LLM generation on too (your queries run first, generated ones after)
python manage.py discover --queries "Head of Data healthcare" --auto-keywords
```

Supplying queries inserts them as `SearchKeyword` rows and sets
`auto_generate_keywords=False` (unless `--auto-keywords` is given). The daemon
and `discover` both honor the flag, so once your queries are exhausted the
pipeline stops searching rather than inventing new keywords.

## Account Settings (Django Model)

Account data is stored in the `LinkedInProfile` Django model (1:1 with `auth.User`), managed via
Django Admin or created during interactive onboarding.

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
|:------|:-----|:------------|:--------|
| `linkedin_username` | string | LinkedIn login email. | (required) |
| `linkedin_password` | string | LinkedIn password. | (required) |
| `active` | boolean | Enable/disable this account. | `true` |
| `subscribe_newsletter` | boolean | Receive OpenOutreach updates. | `true` |
| `connect_daily_limit` | integer | Max connection requests per day. | `20` |
| `follow_up_daily_limit` | integer | Max follow-up messages per day. | `30` |
| `legal_accepted` | boolean | Whether the user accepted the legal notice. | `false` |

Rate limiting is enforced by `LinkedInProfile` methods (`can_execute()`, `record_action()`,
`mark_exhausted()`) backed by the `ActionLog` model, surviving daemon restarts.

### GDPR Location Detection

On the first run, the daemon checks the logged-in user's LinkedIn country code against a static set of
ISO-2 codes for jurisdictions with opt-in email marketing laws (EU/EEA, UK, Switzerland, Canada, Brazil,
Australia, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand).

- **Non-GDPR location**: `subscribe_newsletter` is auto-set to `true` for that account.
- **GDPR-protected location**: the existing value is preserved (no override).
- **Unknown/empty location**: defaults to GDPR-protected (errs on the side of caution).

This check runs once per account (a database marker record prevents re-runs).

## Email Channel Settings

The email channel (LinkedIn for discovery, email for outreach) is **optional** — with nothing
configured, every qualified lead routes to the LinkedIn connection channel. A per-launch onboarding
nudge (`emails/nudge.py`) walks you through the two pieces below until both exist.

### Finder key (`SiteConfig` singleton)

The email finder is configured by a single key on the `SiteConfig` DB singleton, editable via Django
Admin or captured by the onboarding nudge.

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
|:------|:-----|:------------|:--------|
| `bettercontact_api_key` | string | [BetterContact](https://bettercontact.rocks?fpr=openoutreach) API key for LinkedIn→work-email resolution. **Blank disables the paid finder.** | (empty) |

When set, a qualified lead's work email is resolved on demand (`emails/bettercontact.py`); a hit forks
the deal onto the email channel, a miss leaves it on the LinkedIn channel. Misses are free to retry —
the provider bills only usable hits. The first 50 lookups are free with the subscription, so you can
try enrichment at no cost. **Enrichment only runs when a sending mailbox exists** — with no
mailbox to send from, qualified leads route straight to LinkedIn and neither the hub lookup nor the
paid finder is called.

### Sending mailboxes (`Mailbox` Django model)

Each `Mailbox` is one SMTP outbox. Boxes are imported by pasting the [IceMail](https://icemail.ai?via=openoutreach)
*Export Mailboxes* sheet during onboarding (`emails/icemail.py`); each is auth-checked
(`emails/smtp.py`) before it is stored.

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
|:------|:-----|:------------|:--------|
| `host` | string | SMTP host. | `smtp.gmail.com` |
| `port` | integer | SMTP port. | `587` |
| `username` | string | SMTP login (unique). | (required) |
| `password` | string | SMTP password. | (required) |
| `from_address` | string | Envelope/from address for outgoing mail. | (required) |
| `daily_limit` | integer | Warm-safe sends per day for this box, enforced per box at send time. | `DEFAULT_EMAIL_DAILY_LIMIT` |

Sending is raw `smtplib` (`emails/sender.py`); the email queue drains eagerly, capped only by the
pool-wide per-box daily headroom.

## Hardcoded Defaults (`conf.py:CAMPAIGN_CONFIG`)

Timing and ML defaults are hardcoded in `linkedin/conf.py`. These are not user-configurable.

| Key | Value | Description |
|:----|:------|:------------|
| `check_pending_recheck_after_hours` | `24` | Base interval (hours) before first pending check. Doubles per profile via exponential backoff. |
| `enrich_min_delay_seconds` | `6` | Min pause (seconds) between enrichment API calls during auto-discovery. |
| `enrich_max_delay_seconds` | `10` | Max pause (seconds) — actual delay is `random.uniform(min, max)`. |
| `enrich_max_per_page` | `10` | Max profiles enriched per discovered page (DOM order, LinkedIn relevance). |
| `burst_min_seconds` | `2700` | Min work burst (45 min) before the daemon takes a human-rhythm break. |
| `burst_max_seconds` | `3900` | Max work burst (65 min). Actual burst is `random.uniform(min, max)`. |
| `break_min_seconds` | `600` | Min break length (10 min) after each burst. |
| `break_max_seconds` | `1200` | Max break length (20 min). |
| `min_action_interval` | `120` | Minimum seconds between major actions. |
| `qualification_n_mc_samples` | `100` | Monte Carlo samples for BALD computation. |
| `min_ready_to_connect_prob` | `0.9` | GP probability threshold for promoting QUALIFIED to READY_TO_CONNECT. |
| `min_positive_pool_prob` | `0.20` | P(f > 0.5) threshold for positive pool check in exploit mode. |
| `embedding_model` | `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` | FastEmbed model for 384-dim profile embeddings. |
| `connect_delay_seconds` | `10` | Delay between connect tasks. |
| `connect_no_candidate_delay_seconds` | `300` | Delay when candidate pool is empty. |
| `check_pending_jitter_factor` | `0.2` | Multiplicative jitter factor for backoff. |

Other constants: `MIN_DELAY` (5s) / `MAX_DELAY` (8s) for human-like wait timing.
